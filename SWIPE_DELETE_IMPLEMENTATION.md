# Swipe-to-Delete Animation Implementation

## Overview
iOS-style swipe-to-delete animation has been successfully implemented for the Upcoming Events screen. The feature allows users to remove events from their list with smooth, native-feeling animations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Partial Swipe (< 60% of screen width)**
- Swipe an event card left to reveal a red delete button with an X icon
- The card smoothly slides to reveal the button underneath
- Release before 45px and it snaps back to original position
- Release after 45px and it stays open to show the delete button

### 2. **Full Swipe (â‰¥ 60% of screen width)**
- Swipe an event card all the way to the left (past 60% of screen width)
- Automatically triggers deletion with smooth animation
- Card fades out and collapses
- No confirmation needed for full swipe

### 3. **Confirmation Modal**
- When tapping the revealed delete button (partial swipe), a confirmation modal appears
- Modal shows event name and asks for confirmation
- Two options: "Cancel" (returns to normal) or "Delete" (removes the event)
- Modern dark theme matching the app's design
- Smooth fade and scale animations

## Files Created

### `components/SwipeableEventCard.tsx`
- Main swipeable wrapper component
- Handles pan gestures and animations
- Uses `react-native-gesture-handler` for gesture detection
- Uses `react-native-reanimated` for smooth animations
- Red delete button appears behind the card during swipe

### `components/DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx`
- iOS-style confirmation dialog
- Dark theme with semi-transparent backdrop
- Animated entrance with fade and scale effects
- Cancel and Delete buttons with appropriate styling

## Files Modified

### `app/(tabs)/two.tsx`
- Added state management for deleted events
- Added confirmation modal state
- Wrapped event cards with `SwipeableEventCard`
- Filters out deleted events from display
- Handles both auto-delete and confirmation flows

### `app/_layout.tsx`
- Added `GestureHandlerRootView` to enable gestures throughout the app

### `babel.config.js` (created)
- Added `react-native-reanimated/plugin` for proper worklet compilation

### `package.json`
- Added `react-native-gesture-handler@~2.22.1` dependency

## How to Test

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Navigate to "Upcoming Events" tab** (second tab)

3. **Test Partial Swipe:**
   - Swipe an event card slightly to the left (about 100px)
   - See the red delete button with X icon appear
   - Tap the X button
   - Confirm deletion in the modal or cancel

4. **Test Full Swipe:**
   - Swipe an event card all the way to the left (past 60% of screen)
   - Event should automatically delete without confirmation
   - Card animates out smoothly

5. **Test Snap Back:**
   - Start swiping but don't go past 45px
   - Release - card should spring back to original position

6. **Test Multiple Events:**
   - Try swiping different events
   - Each event can be swiped independently
   - Deleted events stay removed until app restart (local state only)

## Animation Details

- **Swipe Gesture:** Uses `PanGestureHandler` from react-native-gesture-handler
- **Spring Animation:** Smooth spring physics when releasing partial swipe
- **Delete Animation:** Opacity fade + height collapse over 250ms
- **Modal Animation:** Backdrop fade + modal scale animation
- **Delete Button:** 90px wide, #FF3B30 (iOS red), white X icon

## Thresholds
```javascript
DELETE_BUTTON_WIDTH = 90px        // Width of delete button
SWIPE_THRESHOLD_FULL = 60% width  // Triggers auto-delete
SNAP_BACK_THRESHOLD = 45px        // Minimum to stay open
```

## Notes
- Events are removed from local state only (not persisted)
- Works seamlessly with ScrollView - no gesture conflicts
- Gestures are properly isolated per card
- Compatible with Expo and React Native new architecture
- iOS-style animations match native Apple apps like Mail

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Persist deleted events to AsyncStorage or database
- Add "Undo" functionality with toast notification
- Animate date group removal when all events are deleted
- Add haptic feedback on delete
- Allow customization of swipe thresholds
