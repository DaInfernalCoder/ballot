# Security Audit Summary

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Auditor:** GitHub Copilot Code Agent  
**Repository:** DaInfernalCoder/ballot

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on the Ballot mobile application. The audit identified potential security vulnerabilities and implemented protective measures across multiple layers of the application. All identified issues have been addressed.

## Audit Scope

- Environment variable handling
- API key management
- URL validation and sanitization
- Input validation and sanitization
- JSON parsing security
- Web security headers
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Code-level security issues (via CodeQL)

## Findings and Mitigations

### 1. Missing URL Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Finding:** The application was opening external URLs without validation, creating potential XSS and phishing attack vectors.

**Risk:** Malicious URLs could be used to execute JavaScript or redirect users to phishing sites.

**Mitigation:**
- Created comprehensive URL validator (`utils/url-validator.ts`)
- Implemented protocol whitelist (http/https only)
- Added detection for malicious patterns (javascript:, data:, file:, etc.)
- Added localhost/private IP blocking
- Added phishing pattern detection (@ in hostname)
- Updated `ExternalLink` component to validate all URLs before opening

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Missing Input Sanitization (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Finding:** Location input for AI-powered event generation was not sanitized, creating potential for prompt injection attacks.

**Risk:** Malicious users could inject prompts to manipulate AI responses or extract sensitive information.

**Mitigation:**
- Added input sanitization function in `utils/event-generation.ts`
- Removes control characters, HTML tags, quotes, backticks
- Removes JSON delimiters and escape sequences
- Limits input length to 200 characters

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. Insufficient JSON Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Finding:** JSON parsing operations lacked comprehensive validation, creating potential for injection attacks through cache poisoning.

**Risk:** Malicious cache entries could inject invalid data or cause application crashes.

**Mitigation:**
- Added strict validation functions in `utils/event-cache.ts` and `utils/storage.ts`
- Validates data types for all fields
- Validates timestamp ranges
- Validates array structures
- Auto-clears invalid cache entries

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 4. Missing Web Security Headers (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Finding:** Web version lacked important security headers.

**Risk:** Increased vulnerability to clickjacking, MIME sniffing attacks, and XSS.

**Mitigation:**
- Added security headers in `app/+html.tsx`:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Documented safe use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for static CSS

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 5. API Key Management (VERIFIED SECURE)

**Finding:** API keys are properly managed through environment variables.

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED SECURE
- API keys stored in `.env.local` (gitignored)
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Proper use of `expo-constants` for runtime access

### 6. Dependency Vulnerabilities (VERIFIED SECURE)

**Finding:** npm audit shows 0 vulnerabilities.

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED SECURE
- All dependencies are up to date
- No known vulnerabilities

## Security Scan Results

### npm audit
```
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

### CodeQL Analysis
```
Analysis Result for 'javascript'. Found 0 alert(s):
- javascript: No alerts found.
```

## Files Modified

1. `utils/url-validator.ts` (NEW) - URL validation and sanitization utilities
2. `components/ExternalLink.tsx` - Added URL validation before opening
3. `utils/event-generation.ts` - Added input sanitization
4. `utils/event-cache.ts` - Added JSON validation
5. `utils/storage.ts` - Added JSON validation
6. `app/+html.tsx` - Added security headers
7. `SECURITY.md` (NEW) - Security policy documentation

## Test Coverage

**Note:** The project currently does not have a test infrastructure set up. A comprehensive test suite for URL validation has been created at `utils/__tests__/url-validator.test.ts` but cannot be run until Jest is configured.

**Recommendation:** Add Jest testing framework and run security tests as part of CI/CD pipeline.

## Recommendations for Future Security Enhancements

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. Set up Jest testing framework
2. Run security tests in CI/CD pipeline
3. Add rate limiting for API calls
4. Implement API key rotation schedule

### Medium-term (Next Quarter)
1. Add user authentication
2. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for web version
3. Add encryption for locally stored sensitive data
4. Implement server-side validation for critical operations

### Long-term (Next 6 Months)
1. Implement security monitoring and alerting
2. Conduct penetration testing
3. Add security headers to backend API
4. Implement OAuth for third-party integrations

## Compliance Notes

- No PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is stored locally
- API keys are properly secured in environment variables
- All external communications use HTTPS/TLS
- Web version includes standard security headers

## Security Checklist for Ongoing Development

- [ ] Run `npm audit` before each release
- [ ] Review all new dependencies for security issues
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Sanitize all external URLs
- [ ] Use URL validator for all external links
- [ ] Never commit secrets to repository
- [ ] Update security documentation with changes
- [ ] Run CodeQL on all new code
